1. What is the difference between a class and an object?

An object is an instance of a class - a class could be considered the 'blueprint' for an object defined by the class.


2. How is a class defined?

class NameHere {}


3. What does each object have its own copy of?

It has its own copies of the variables assigned within its class.


4. Using two separate statements, show how to declare an object called counter of a class called MyCounter.

class counter {method;
              variable = something;}

MyCounter = new counter(variable);



5. Show how a method called myMeth( ) is declared if it has a return type of double and has two int parameters called a and b.

myMeth(int a, int b);


6. How must a method return if it returns a value?

By using the statement:

return value;

The method in which it is used must have a non-void return type.




7. What name does a constructor have?

The constructor must have the name of its enclosing class.



8. What does new do?

new creates a new object of a class.


9. What is garbage collection, and how does it work? What is finalize( )?

Garbage collection locates objects not being used and frees up the space they are
using in memory. Finalize() is a method that only occurs if garbage collection is 
due to occur, and makes sure the enclosing object is terminated cleanly.


10. What is this?

'this' implicitly refers to the object to which a parameter belongs.


11. Can a constructor have one or more parameters?

Yes, a constructor can have one or more parameters.


12. If a method returns no value, what must its return type be?

Its return type must be void.
