1. What is bytecode and why is it important to Java’s use for Internet programming?

Bytecode is a set of instructions that JVM uses. It's useful because then one only
needs to have the JVM to run any java program - nothing else matters. This means that different
CPUs can all use the same version of a java program. 

2.What are the three main principles of object-oriented programming?

Encapsulation (or in other words, objects/classes)
Polymorphism (which means classes, I think)
Inheritance (which means child classes and parent classes)

3. Where do Java programs begin execution?

The Java Virtual Machine

4. What is a variable?

A variable is (title/name that is assigned a value) 
(better described as a value that is assigned a name?,
hence why you can't start a variable name with numbers?)


5. Which of the following variable names is invalid? 

A. count

B. $count

C. count27 

D. 67count27 ::::INVALID



6. How do you create a single-line comment? How do you create a multiline comment?

// single line comment

/* Multi
* line
* comment 
*/



7. Show the general form of the if statement. Show the general form of the for loop.

if(blah) something

for(variable, variable limit, variable increase) do_something


8. How do you create a block of code?

Simply put it in {} brackets

EG:

for(blah, blah<something, blah = blah - 1) {
    code, more code = the way to do it
    }


9. The moon’s gravity is about 17 percent that of earth’s. Write a program that computes your effective weight on the moon.


class EarthToMoon {
    public static void main(String argsp[]) {
    double weight;

    moon_weight = weight * 0.17

    System.out.println(moon_weight)
    }
}


10. Adapt Try This 1-2 so that it prints a conversion table of inches to meters. Display 12 feet of conversions, inch by inch. Output a blank line every 12 inches. (One meter equals approximately 39.37 inches.)


class GalToLitTable {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
￼￼￼     double inches, meters;
        int counter;

        counter = 0;
        
        for(inches = 1; inches <= 144; inches++) {
            meters = inches * 2.54; // convert to meters
            System.out.println(inches + " inches is " +
                            meters + " meters.");
            counter++;
            if(counter == 12) {
                System.out.println();
                counter = 0; // reset the line counter
            }
        }
    }
}



11. If you make a typing mistake when entering your program, what sort of error will result?

A syntax error.


12. Does it matter where on a line you put a statement?

No, it doesn't matter.
