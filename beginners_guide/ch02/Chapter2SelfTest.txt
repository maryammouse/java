Chapter 2 Self Test

1. Why does Java strictly specify the range and behavior of its primitive types?

For safety/security's sake.

2. What is Javaâ€™s character type, and how does it differ from the character type used by some other programming languages?

char, and some mathematical operators can be legally applied to it, unlike in some other languages.

3. A boolean value can have any value you like because any non-zero value is true. True or False?

False. A boolean can only have the values True and False.

4. Given this output,

One 
Two 
Three

using a single string, show the println( ) statement that produced it.

println(One \n Two \n Three);

5. What is wrong with this fragment?

    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int sum;
        sum = sum + i; 
    }
    System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);

The problem is that sum is not initialized before we use it recursively in the line
sum = sum + i;

6. Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator.

The difference is in when the incrementation is applied 
(before means it will find the operand before applying the whole number
to the rest of the expression, and after means after).

7. Show how a short-circuit AND can be used to prevent a divide-by-zero error.

if (3>10 && 3/0 = 3)...

In this case, the second part of the if statement will not run and produce an error
since the first part is already false.

8. In an expression, what type are byte and short promoted to? 

They are promoted to long.

9. In general, when is a cast needed?

When making narrowing conversions.

10. Write a program that finds all of the prime numbers between 2 and 100.

int i;

for(i=2, i < 100, i++) {
    bool isprime;
    isprime = True;

    int j;

    for(j=2, j < i, j++) {
        if((i%j) == 0) isprime = False;
    }
    if(isprime)
        System.out.println(i + "is prime.")
}


11. Does the use of redundant parentheses affect program performance?

Nope!

12. Does a block define a scope?

Nope, curly-brackets do.
